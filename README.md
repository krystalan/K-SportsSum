The concepts used in Category are illustrated as follows:  
- `Dataset`: The work contributes a dataset for sports game summarization.
- `Ext.`: Extractive sports game summarization method.
- `Ext.+Temp.`: The method first extracts important commentary sentence and further utilize the human-labeled template to convey each commentary sentence to a news sentence.
- `Ext.+Abs.`: The method first extracts important commentary sentence and further utilize the seq2seq model to convey each commentary sentence to the news sentence.
